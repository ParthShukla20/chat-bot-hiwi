It refers to the tax payable by the seller which he collects from the buyer at the time of sale. Section 206C of the Income-tax Act governs TCS. It is applicable to various transactions including the sale of goods, providing services, and under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) for overseas remittances[doc2].\n\nIn the context of foreign remittances under the LRS, TCS is charged when the amount remitted exceeds Rs. 7 lakh in a financial year. The rate of TCS for educational purposes is 0.5% if the remittance is financed by an education loan, or otherwise, it is 5%. For other purposes, the TCS rate is higher, up to 20% if the threshold of Rs. 7 lakh is crossed[doc2].\n\nPlease note that the information provided is based on the documents retrieved and should not be considered as up-to-date legal advice. Always consult the latest guidelines from the Income Tax Department or a tax professional for current rates and regulations.",
